The jury will choose a positive\n(greater than zero)\ninteger $$$w$$$, which denotes the weight of the barbell that will be used in the competition. The goal for each athlete is to lift the barbell as many times as possible.

Otherwise, the $$$i$$$-th athlete will be able to lift the barbell, and the number of times he does it will be equal to his endurance $$$e_i$$$.\nFor example, suppose there are $$$4$$$ athletes with parameters $$$s_1 = 7, e_1 = 4$$$; $$$s_2 = 9, e_2 = 3$$$; $$$s_3 = 4, e_3 = 6$$$; $$$s_4 = 2, e_4 = 2$$$.

Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring\u00a0\u2014 1 point, the next ring\u00a0\u2014 2 points, ..., the center ring\u00a0\u2014 5 points.\nVlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.\nInput\nThe input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 1000$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nEach test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $$$\\texttt{X}$$$ (representing an arrow) or $$$\\texttt{.}$$$ (representing no arrow).\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer\u00a0\u2014 the total number of points of the arrows.\nExample\nInput\n4\nX.........\n..........\n.......X..\n.....X....\n......X...\n..........\n.........X\n..X.......\n..........\n.........X\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n....X.....\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\n..........\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nXXXXXXXXXX\nOutput\n17\n0\n5\n220\nNote\nIn the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is $$$3 \\times 1 + 2 \\times 3 + 2 \\times 4 = 17$$$.\nIn the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is $$$0$$$."

Chaneka can do that operation multiple times, even for different elements.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times A_3 \\times \\ldots \\times A_N = 0$$$?\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$N$$$ ($$$1 \\leq N \\leq 10^5$$$).\nThe second line contains $$$N$$$ integers $$$A_1, A_2, A_3, \\ldots, A_N$$$ ($$$-10^5 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^5$$$).\nOutput\nAn integer representing the minimum number of operations that must be done to make it such that $$$A_1 \\times A_2 \\times A_3 \\times \\ldots \\times A_N = 0$$$.\nExamples\nInput\n3\n2 -6 5\nOutput\n2\nInput\n1\n-3\nOutput\n3\nInput\n5\n0 -1 0 1 0\nOutput\n0\nNote\nIn the first example, initially, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=2\\times(-6)\\times5=-60$$$. Chaneka can do the following sequence of operations:\nDecrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=1\\times(-6)\\times5=-30$$$\nDecrease the value of $$$A_1$$$ by $$$1$$$. Then, $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3=0\\times(-6)\\times5=0$$$\nIn the third example, Chaneka does not have to do any operations, because from the start, it already holds that $$$A_1\\times A_2\\times A_3\\times A_4\\times A_5=0\\times(-1)\\times0\\times1\\times0=0$$$"

            "A. Escalator Conversations\nOne day, Vlad became curious about who he can have a conversation with on the escalator in the subway. There are a total of $$$n$$$ passengers. The escalator has a total of $$$m$$$ steps, all steps indexed from $$$1$$$ to $$$m$$$ and $$$i$$$-th step has height $$$i \\cdot k$$$.\nVlad's height is $$$H$$$ centimeters. Two people with heights $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$ can have a conversation on the escalator if they are standing on\ndifferent\nsteps and the height difference between them is equal to the height difference between the steps.\nFor example, if two people have heights $$$170$$$ and $$$180$$$ centimeters, and $$$m = 10, k = 5$$$, then they can stand on steps numbered $$$7$$$ and $$$5$$$, where the height difference between the steps is equal to the height difference between the two people: $$$k \\cdot 2 = 5 \\cdot 2 = 10 = 180 - 170$$$. There are other possible ways.\nGiven an array $$$h$$$ of size $$$n$$$, where $$$h_i$$$ represents the height of the $$$i$$$-th person. Vlad is interested in how many people he can have a conversation with on the escalator\nindividually\n.\nFor example, if $$$n = 5, m = 3, k = 3, H = 11$$$, and $$$h = [5, 4, 14, 18, 2]$$$, Vlad can have a conversation with the person with height $$$5$$$ (Vlad will stand on step $$$1$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$3$$$) and with the person with height $$$14$$$ (for example, Vlad can stand on step $$$3$$$, and the other person will stand on step $$$2$$$).

The first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 500$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 100$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$a_i = \\pm 1$$$) \u2014 the elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u2014 the minimum number of operations that need to be done to make the $$$a$$$ array good.\nExample\nInput\n7\n4\n-1 -1 1 -1\n5\n-1 -1 -1 1 1\n4\n-1 1 -1 1\n3\n-1 -1 -1\n5\n1 1 1 1 1\n1\n-1\n2\n-1 -1\nOutput\n1\n1\n0\n3\n0\n1\n2\nNote\nIn the first test case, we can assign the value $$$a_1 := 1$$$. Then $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = 1 + (-1) + 1 + (-1) = 0 \\ge 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot a_3 \\cdot a_4 = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) = 1$$$. Thus, we performed $$$1$$$ operation.\nIn the second test case, we can assign $$$a_1 := 1$$$. Then $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 = 1 + (-1) + (-1) + 1 + 1 = 1 \\ge 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot a_3 \\cdot a_4 \\cdot a_5 = 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$$. Thus, we performed $$$1$$$ operation.\nIn the third test case, $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 = (-1) + 1 + (-1) + 1 = 0 \\ge 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot a_3 \\cdot a_4 = (-1) \\cdot 1 \\cdot (-1) \\cdot 1 = 1$$$. Thus, all conditions are already satisfied and no operations are needed.\nIn the fourth test case, we can assign the values $$$a_1 := 1, a_2 := 1, a_3 := 1$$$. Then $$$a_1 + a_2 + a_3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 \\ge 0$$$ and $$$a_1 \\cdot a_2 \\cdot a_3 = 1 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 1 = 1$$$. Thus, we performed $$$3$$$ operations."

Also:\nstring must start with non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\nm\n' or '\nM\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\ne\n' or '\nE\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\no\n' or '\nO\n'\nit must be immediately followed by non-empty sequence consisting only of characters '\nw\n' or '\nW\n', this sequence ends the string, after it immediately comes the string end\nFor example, strings \"\nmeow\n\", \"\nmmmEeOWww\n\", \"\nMeOooOw\n\" describe a meowing, but strings \"\nMweo\n\", \"\nMeO\n\", \"\nmoew\n\", \"\nMmEW\n\", \"\nmeowmeow\n\" do not.\nDetermine whether the sound you heard was a cat meowing or something else.\nInput\nThe first line of input data contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.\nThe description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the string describing the sound.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of $$$n$$$ characters. The string describes the sound you heard and consists only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a separate line:\nYES\nif the sound was a cat meowing;\nNO\notherwise.\nYou can output\nYES\nand\nNO\nin any case (for example, strings\nyEs\n,\nyes\n,\nYes\nand\nYES\nwill be recognized as positive response).\nExample\nInput\n7\n4\nmeOw\n14\nmMmeoOoWWWwwwW\n3\nmew\n7\nMmeEeUw\n4\nMEOW\n6\nMmyaVW\n5\nmeowA\nOutput\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\nYES\nNO\nNO\nNote\nIn the first test case, the string consists of a sequence of characters '\nm\n', '\ne\n', '\nO\n', '\nw\n', which satisfies the definition of meowing.\nIn the second test case, the string consists of a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters '\nm\n' and '\nM\n', one '\ne\n', a sequence of $$$3$$$ characters '\no\n' and '\nO\n' and a sequence of $$$7$$$ characters '\nw\n' and '\nW\n', which satisfies the definition of meowing.\nIn the third test case, the string does not describe a meowing because it lacks a sequence of '\no\n' or '\nO\n' characters between '\ne\n' and '\nw\n'.\nIn the fourth test case, the string contains the character '\nU\n', so it does not describe a meowing."

You see all these strings and wonder if Marcos' favorite string is a palindrome or not.

For example, if Polycarp remembered $$$\\pi$$$ as $$$3.1415$$$, he wrote out\n31415\n.\nPolycarp was in a hurry and could have made a mistake, so you decided to check how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp actually remembers correctly.\nInput\nThe first line of the input data contains the single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 10^3$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases in the test.\nEach test case is described by a single string of digits $$$n$$$, which was written out by Polycarp.\nThe string $$$n$$$ contains up to $$$30$$$ digits.\nOutput\nOutput $$$t$$$ integers, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case, that is how many first digits of the number $$$\\pi$$$ Polycarp remembers correctly.\nExample\nInput\n9\n000\n3\n4141592653\n141592653589793238462643383279\n31420\n31415\n314159265358\n27182\n314159265358979323846264338327\nOutput\n0\n1\n0\n0\n3\n5\n12\n0\n30"

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a positive integer $$$n$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the number of trophies.\nThe second line of each test case contains a string $$$s$$$ of length $$$n$$$ consisting only of characters '\nL\n' and '\nR\n' \u00a0\u2014 the $$$i$$$-th character describes the direction of the $$$i$$$-th lamp.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$100\\,000$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case print $$$-1$$$ if it is impossible to illuminate all trophies by performing one operation (or doing nothing). Otherwise, print $$$0$$$ if you choose not to perform the operation (i.e., the trophies are illuminated by the initial positioning of the lamps), or an index $$$i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq i < n$$$) if you choose to swap lamps $$$i$$$ and $$$i+1$$$.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\nExample\nInput\n6\n2\nLL\n2\nLR\n2\nRL\n2\nRR\n7\nLLRLLLR\n7\nRRLRRRL\nOutput\n-1\n1\n0\n-1\n3\n6\nNote\nIn the first example, it is possible to swap lamps $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$, or do nothing. In any case, the string \"\nLL\n\" is obtained. Not all trophies are illuminated since trophy $$$2$$$ is not illuminated by any lamp \u00a0\u2014 lamp $$$1$$$ illuminates nothing and lamp $$$2$$$ illuminates only the trophy $$$1$$$.\nIn the second example, it is necessary to swap lamps $$$1$$$ and $$$2$$$. The string becomes \"\nRL\n\". Trophy $$$1$$$ is illuminated by lamp $$$2$$$ and trophy $$$2$$$ is illuminated by lamp $$$1$$$, hence it is possible to illuminate all trophies.\nIn the third example, all trophies are initially illuminated \u00a0\u2014 hence, not performing any operation is a valid solution.\nIn the last two examples performing swaps is not necessary as all trophies are illuminated initially. But, the presented solutions are also valid."

If the names cannot be recovered, print \"\n:(\n\" (without quotes).\nExample\nInput\n5\nbbba\naba\naaa\nabba\nabbb\nOutput\nb bb a\na b a\na a a\nab b a\na bb b\nNote\nA string $$$x$$$ is lexicographically smaller than a string $$$y$$$ if and only if one of the following holds:\n$$$x$$$ is a prefix of $$$y$$$, but $$$x \\ne y$$$;\nin the first position where $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$ differ, the string $$$x$$$ has the letter '\na\n', and the string $$$y$$$ has the letter '\nb\n'.\nNow let's move on to the examples.\nIn the first test case, one of the possible ways to split the line $$$s$$$ into three lines\u00a0\u2014 \"\nb\n\", \"\nbb\n\", \"\na\n\".\nIn the third test case, we can see that the split satisfies two conditions at once (i.\u00a0e., $$$a \\le b$$$, $$$c \\le b$$$, $$$b \\le a$$$, and $$$b \\le c$$$ are true simultaneously)."

For example, $$$9$$$ and $$$6$$$ written in base $$$2$$$ are $$$1001$$$ and $$$110$$$, respectively.\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 128$$$) \u2014 the number of testcases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 512$$$) \u2014 the length of array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i < 1024$$$) \u2014 the elements of array $$$a$$$.\nIt's guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all testcases does not exceed $$$512$$$.\nOutput\nFor each testcase, print one integer \u2014 the maximum possible value of $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a)$$$.\nExample\nInput\n4\n3\n1 0 1\n4\n5 5 5 5\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n7\n20 85 100 41 76 49 36\nOutput\n1\n0\n7\n125\nNote\nIn the first example, it can be shown that we do not need to perform any operations \u2014 the maximum value of $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a)$$$ is $$$1 - 0 = 1$$$.\nIn the second example, no operation can change the array \u2014 the maximum value of $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a)$$$ is $$$5 - 5 = 0$$$.\nIn the third example, initially $$$a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$$$, we can perform one operation taking $$$i = 2$$$, $$$j = 5$$$, $$$b = 1$$$. The array now becomes $$$a = [1, 0, 3, 4, 7]$$$. It can be shown that any further operations do not lead to a better answer \u2014 therefore the answer is $$$\\max(a) - \\min(a) = 7 - 0 = 7$$$."

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ space-separated integers $$$a_1,a_2,\\ldots,a_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^6$$$) \u2014 representing the array $$$a$$$.\nDo note that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases is not bounded.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of operations needed to make $$$a$$$ good.\nExample\nInput\n4\n4\n1 1 1 1\n2\n7 4\n3\n1 2 4\n1\n15\nOutput\n0\n2\n1\n4\nNote\nIn the first test case, array $$$a$$$ is already\ngood\n.\nIn the second test case, we can perform on index $$$2$$$ twice. After the first operation, array $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[7,2]$$$. After performing on index $$$2$$$ again, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[7,1]$$$, which is\ngood\n. It can be proved that it is not possible to make $$$a$$$\ngood\nin less number of operations.\nIn the third test case, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0,2,4]$$$ if we perform the operation on index $$$1$$$ once. As $$$[0,2,4]$$$ is\ngood\n, answer is $$$1$$$.\nIn the fourth test case, we need to perform the operation on index $$$1$$$ four times. After all operations, $$$a$$$ becomes $$$[0]$$$. It can be proved that it is not possible to make $$$a$$$\ngood\nin less number of operations."

The description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the length of the array $$$a$$$.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1,a_2 \\ldots a_n$$$ $$$(-10^9 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 elements of the array $$$a$$$.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2\\cdot 10^5$$$.\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer \u00a0\u2014 the maximum possible value of $$$|sum(s_1)| - |sum(s_2)|$$$.\nExample\nInput\n4\n2\n10 -10\n4\n-2 -1 11 0\n3\n2 3 2\n5\n-9 2 0 0 -4\nOutput\n0\n8\n7\n11\nNote\nIn the\nfirst testcase\n, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \\{10\\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\{-10\\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|10| - |-10| = 0$$$.\nIn the\nsecond testcase\n, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \\{0, 11, -1\\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\{-2\\}$$$. Then the value will be $$$|0 + 11 - 1| - |-2| = 10 - 2 = 8$$$.\nIn the\nthird testcase\n, we can distribute as $$$s_1 = \\{2, 3, 2\\}$$$, $$$s_2 = \\{\\}$$$.

Decode String\nProgramming constraints: DO NOT use the following techniques\n- for loop\n- matrix operation\n- if statement\n- pass statement\n- while loop\nPolycarp has a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters.\nHe encodes it using the following algorithm.\nHe goes through the letters of the string $$$s$$$ from left to right and for each letter Polycarp considers its number in the alphabet:\nif the letter number is single-digit number (less than $$$10$$$), then just writes it out;\nif the letter number is a two-digit number (greater than or equal to $$$10$$$), then it writes it out and adds the number\n0\nafter.\nFor example, if the string $$$s$$$ is\ncode\n, then Polycarp will encode this string as follows:\n'\nc\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$3$$$-rd letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n3\nto the code (the code becomes equal to\n3\n);\n'\no\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$15$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n15\nto the code and also\n0\n(the code becomes\n3150\n);\n'\nd\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$4$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Consequently, Polycarp adds\n4\nto the code (the code becomes\n31504\n);\n'\ne\n'\u00a0\u2014 is the $$$5$$$-th letter of the alphabet. Therefore, Polycarp adds\n5\nto the code (the code becomes\n315045\n).\nThus, code of string\ncode\nis\n315045\n.\nYou are given a string $$$t$$$ resulting from encoding the string $$$s$$$. Your task is to decode it (get the original string $$$s$$$ by $$$t$$$).\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer $$$q$$$ ($$$1 \\le q \\le 10^4$$$) \u2014 the number of test cases in the input.\nThe descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of description of each test case contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 50$$$) \u2014 the length of the given code.\nThe second line of the description of each test case contains a string $$$t$$$ of length $$$n$$$ \u2014 the given code. It is guaranteed that there exists such a string of lowercase Latin letters, as a result of encoding which the string $$$t$$$ is obtained.\nOutput\nFor each test case output the required string $$$s$$$ \u2014 the string that gives string $$$t$$$ as the result of encoding. It is guaranteed that such a string always exists. It can be shown that such a string is always unique.\nExample\nInput\n9\n6\n315045\n4\n1100\n7\n1213121\n6\n120120\n18\n315045615018035190\n7\n1111110\n7\n1111100\n5\n11111\n4\n2606\nOutput\ncode\naj\nabacaba\nll\ncodeforces\naaaak\naaaaj\naaaaa\nzf\nNote\nThe first test case is explained above.\nIn the second test case, the answer is\naj\n. Indeed, the number of the letter\na\nis equal to $$$1$$$, so\n1\nwill be appended to the code. The number of the letter\nj\nis $$$10$$$, so\n100\nwill be appended to the code. The resulting code is\n1100\n.\nThere are no zeros in the third test case, which means that the numbers of all letters are less than $$$10$$$ and are encoded as one digit. The original string is\nabacaba\n.\nIn the fourth test case, the string $$$s$$$ is equal to\nll\n. The letter\nl\nhas the number $$$12$$$ and is encoded as\n120\n. So\nll\nis indeed\n120120\n."
